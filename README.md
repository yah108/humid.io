"Hi, my name is David Choi. I am trying to shape my idea to a reality."
It's a Music/Video Player, a private or public group which can craft Music/Video by communicating with users. The uploader(admin) can invite users to give permission to a file(audio/video). The users in a group can leave their comments on specific timeline/frame. Play and Stop (or move the timeline to specific timeline/frame) and leave a comment on any the timeline/frame. The admin can make changes and re-upload the file and communicate with the group. Design and functionality wise all uploads and discussions are in one chatroom in time order. Users can scroll up and down. Every upload, comment is time printed. Group members shall have the option get notification when there is a upload, comment etc. There are lot more ideas that I want to add to this platform. I have to start from somewhere so I shall let God lead me all the way.
