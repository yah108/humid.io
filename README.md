"Hi, my name is David Choi. I am trying to shape my idea into a reality."
It's a Audio/Video Player, a private or public group which can craft Audio/Video by communicating with users. The uploader(admin) can invite users and give them permission to grant access to access the file(audio/video). The users in a group can leave their comments on specific timeline/frame of the uploaded content. Play and Stop or move the timeline to a specific timeline/frame by scrubbing (*micro increments). The admin can make changes and re-upload the file and communicate with the group. (UI/UX *Just like a blog post.) Design and functionality - All uploads and discussions are in one chatroom in time order. Users can scroll up and down. Every upload and comments are time printed. Group members shall have the option get notification when there is a upload, comment etc. There are lot more ideas that I want to add to this platform.
